# Linear-Regression

Realization in VHDL of an IP Core that implements the operations needed to calculate the coefficients m and q of a straight interpolator. In the inferential statistic this method takes the name of Linear Regression and is used to make estimates and predictions given a certain set of data. Calculations are performed with fixed-point values.
Work commissioned by Aster.
